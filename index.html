              The walipini allows you to grow food 365 days a year. 24 hours a day. <br>
              7 days a week. Anywhere in the world. Essentially it is a pit greenhouse. <br>
              It does not matter what the surface temperature is on Earth. Because a few <br>
              feet down the temperature is maintained at a constant degree. It does not <br>
              matter if the temperature is 0 degrees in the dead of winter or 100 <br>
              degrees in the heat of the summer... a few feet down and it is a constant<br>
              50-60 degrees.With a little sunlight the wallipini can be warmed and <br>
              additional 10-30 degrees. Making it ideal to grow food. Combined with <br>
              vertical aquaponics (wherein you can grow 1,000,000 lbs. of food & 10,000 <br>
              fish on 3 acres) this is essentially a grocery store for an entire village<br>
              all year long potentially. If you have one walipini for food and another for<br>
              plant based medicine (pharamcognosy) and a third for hemp (a non <br>
              psychoactive cousin of marijuana that was used for many commercial uses <br>
              and today over 5,000 industrial uses)... you have the ability to maintain an <br>
              entire village indefinetely. Further with C02 leeching the quality of food<br>
              out... it will become increasingly important to have all your food growing <br>
              in greenhouses to maintain sufficient vitamin levels for the human body as<br>
              climate shifts. Otherwise what you do grow will be about as good for your <br>
              body as eating cardboard essentially, in time. I cannot emphasize this<br>
              enough.... LEARN THIS.

      <div class="text">How do you make a cup? A frying pan? The answer is that you <br>
             need to know how to melt metal and pour it into a sand mould. <br>
            In order to do that you need to know alot of things. Metal casting <br>
            is quite literally a lost art but is a requirement of the modern <br>
            civillization that surrounds most people in a 1st world country. <br>
            Without sand casting you cannot have modern civillization precisely <br>
            because in order to make a power plant you must know how to make a  <br>
            metal drum. Or a condensation metal tube. or... ad nauseum. Below are  <br>
            the lost formularies of the constituent base materials needed to use this <br>
            skill. It is an art and a skill that few mastered. Today most castings <br>
            are done by highly complex machinery. However it is possibleto do it <br>
            by hand. Greensand can be used many times over for low heat castings <br>
            such like aluminum or brass. They require a lower heat to cast with. <br>
            Iron requires a petro bonded sand because it requires such a high heat <br>
            to work with. Core making is creating a hard sand that makes a void such <br>
            like in a casting of a cup. The negative space is made up by a "core". <br>
            Clay crucibles are used once. Graphite crucibles c an be used a few times <br>
            to cast with. You need a furnace mortar mix to make the furnance immune <br>
            to all the flames so that the heat is swirling around the crucible heating <br>
            it and melting the metal within the crucible and not the furnace itself.<br>

            a oil holder such like a drip pan for a car elevated so that it flows <br>

            At the other end of the pipe we have a hair dryer to blow the oil forward <br>
            towards the furnace wherein it is lit and thus the flame circles around <br>
            the crucible. Without electricity the option is to use a pair of bellows <br>

            we also understand how to build a furnace and how to make the required <br>
            commodities to use in a casting... how exactly do we cast a metal object? <br>
            Here are the required steps in order. A casting is essentially a copy of <br>
            any object turned into metal. Withut objects you can alwasy carve the item <br>
            out of wood first and cut the item in half. This is called a mould. The cope <br>
            and drag are simply boards joined together to form a square large enough <br>
            to hold the mould in. one square for each half of your mould.<br>

      <div class="text">One of the first things after you have settled in to your home to cast <br>
            Is a way to determine earthquakes. Why? Because should the precipitating <br>
            factor of the electric grid being taken away be due to Nuclear war....the <br>
            tectonic after effects will be spectacular. You already have a means to <br>
            determine weather and forecast however you still need to be able to tell <br>
            when the shaking will stop. Even if non nuclear means are used to dismantle <br>
            the grid you will still need an earthquake detector to determine if there are <br>
            secondary explosions occuring from such like powerplants or nuclear facilities <br>
            nearby. The chinese made a very simple and genius way of determining that. <br>

            to manage with some metal casting, the next important thing to do is to <br>
            ramp up our food production. You can grow 1,000,000 lbs. of food and <br>
            10,000 fish on 3 acres. Yes THREE ACRES. with a style of food crop <br>
            production known as aquaponics. In simplistic terms the fish (normally <br>
            tilapia) feed the plants and the plants feed the fish in an infinite <br>
            loop. Growing vertically the fish poop feeds the filter plants (duckweed<br>
            usually) at the top tray. Then the water descends and feeds the second<br>
            tray gathering nutrients from the plant roots. Eventually dropping back<br>
            down into the aquarium wherein a simple pump lifts the water back to the<br>
            top. Ad infinitum. You can place two aquaponics gardens in each walipini<br>
            with the given dimensions of the walipini alresdy measured out for you.<br>
            Essentially turning each wallipini into three wallipinis. You want a<br>
            curved fish tank bottom to accomodate the run off. Lifting the water<br>
            can be done with electricity or it can be done with a water ram effect<br>
            that I will show you later. Take heed. I am not a liscened electrician.<br>

            But is there an alternative, now that we know a great deal more? Yes. <br>

            turned by steam hitting partitions on the disk. It is cast the same as any <br>
            other metal casting so it is within reach of the normal casting. The bigger <br>

            through them, wherein the steam flows over the pipes. After hitting <br>
            sufficient pipe turns the steam coalesces back to water and is sent <br>
            back to the pipe that is being heated with the fresnel lens. That pipe <br>
            generates the steam that begins the process all over again. Does this mean<br>
            Your village can have electrcity again? No. It means the power plant is <br>
            simple enough to construct but it takes much knowledge to distribute that <br>
            electricity to the village via step down units, transformers power lines etc. <br>
            All those will need to be replaced in case of EMP too, however that is far<br>

            A bandage that helps staunch bleeding is essential then at times of accident. <br>

            After bandaging and cleaning there will be pain to deal with. AFTER the <br>
            bleeding has stopped and the wound is healing you can consider aspirin. <br>
            Aspirin thins the blood and can cause more extensive bleeding. So as a <br>
            pain management it is only apropos for people without bleeding whether <br>
            internally or externally and also only when no other contraindications <br>
            are present such like age or polypharmacy (using other drugs that would <br>
            have a synergistic effect). Bear n mind that this is not true aspirin<br>
            and prolonged usage can cause stomach bleeding. Always take with food.<br>
            Be very careful of the dosage because you can toxify a liver if you take<br>
            too much aspirin in a day(beyond 2000mg if memory serves). Collect the <br>
            Inner cambium layer of the tree bark to use. <br>

    <h2 class="section-heading" >A Fair price plan</h2>
    <p >Fair and affordable price plans for your order. I will craft 8 pens a day at most. To ensure quality.<br>
      I offer out the following as an explanation into how the prices have been set. I must charge a fair and balanced scale due to my religious beliefs. <br>
      Yes, there exist people charging 100's of dollars for a single pen sighting supply demand (not many know how or care to do it as a profession) I however, will show you what is fair: <br>
       Materials to craft are normally about $20 (pen kits from rockler, blanks, and a apropos drill bit, replacement parts( wear and tear on a mandril new tools), box to package etc.<br>
       Sales Taxation due is 8.25%: $4.95 for a pen at $60, and $6.19 at $75 special orders.<br>
        Shipping is about $5 per pen (1st class).<br>
         Leaving a profit margin on a normal pen of: $30.05, and a profit margin on a special order of: $43.81 <br>
          Business taxation of 30% of profit leaves::$21.03, and $30.67 </p>
Assuming 8 normal pens a day (an hour per pen to make them) is $168.24/day or $3,364.8/month (2 days off per week) or about $40,377.60/year "take home". Which is a normal craftsman salary as compared to: Journeyman workers for electric, plumbing, masonry, bench jewelers etc. Meaning Fair.<br>
